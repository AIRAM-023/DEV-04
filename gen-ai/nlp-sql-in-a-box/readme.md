# NLP to SQL in-a-box
![banner](../../media/images/banner-nlp-to-sql-in-a-box.png)
Build a cutting-edge speech-enabled SQL query system using Azure Open AI, Semantic Kernel, and Azure AI Speech Service

We will use the power of Azure Open AI and Semantic Kernel to translate your natural language queries into SQL statements that can be executed against an SQL Server database. This will allow you to interact with your data in a more intuitive and user-friendly way. No more struggling with complex SQL syntax â€“ just speak your query and let the system do the rest!

And with Azure Speech Services, we will convert your speech into text and synthesize the results as speech. This means that you can hear the results of your query spoken back to you, making it easier to understand and digest the information.

## MOVED
