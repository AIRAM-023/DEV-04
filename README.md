Starting your AI/ML journey in Azure may seem daunting for some organizations and engineers, often leading to roadblocks in their initial scenarios. To address this challenge, providing a user-friendly and intuitive template becomes crucial. Such a template should serve as a guiding example, illustrating the complete AI/ML lifecycle, showcasing the integration of MLOps practices, detailing the setup of training pipelines, and offering insights into the processes of model training, deployment, and access. This ensures a smoother and more comprehensible transition into the world of Azure AI and ML.

This project aims to provide an "Azure AI/ML Easy Button" for common scenarios. Something that shows how the pieces fit together in easy to deploy templates. Using the **patterns** available here, engineers will be able to quickly setup a Azure ML/AI/Edge environment which optionally includes streaming & batch ingestion, Model training and creation, Scaling patterns and edge deployments.

## Architecture


## Available Patterns
This repository contains several scenarios, or, 'patterns' for you to deploy into your own environment. Below is a summary:
* **Pattern 1**: AI-in-a-Box (ML) Azure ML Integration - Outer Loop (Landing) and Model Inner Loop (MLOps)
* **Pattern 2**: AI-in-a-Box (EdgeAI) Edge AI from model creation (MLOps) to deployment on Edge Devices (IoT Edge and Azure IoT Operations)
* **Pattern 3**: AI-in-a-Box (AI Services) Azure AI Services (Document Intelligence, Vision AI, Anomaly Detection, Speech) and AOAI Integration
* **Pattern 4**: AI-in-a-Box (AOAI) - Landing with RAG Pattern
