# [WIP] Pattern 4.2. Deploy Semantic Kernel with Bot Framework SDK

## Use case scenario

You are looking to deploy an enterprise-grade virtual assistant using advanced patterns with Azure OpenAI, such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), plugins, OAuth and more. This pattern will deploy an Application Landing Zone and the required code to run Semantic Kernel as a virtual assistant app that can be integrated with many different channels.

This is a code-first option, and as such requires some coding knowledge. If your team is no familiar with Bot Framework SDK, Pattern 4.1 is likely a better fit for you.
