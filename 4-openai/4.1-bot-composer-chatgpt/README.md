# [WIP] Pattern 4.1. Deploy ChatGPT with Bot Composer

## Use case scenario

You are getting started with Azure OpenAI and deploying a ChatGPT-like experience to your own tenant. This pattern will deploy an Application Landing Zone with all the resources you need to run GPT-3.5-turbo in a way that is both secure and scalable.

This is a low code option, and as such requires very little coding knowledge, at the expense of some flexibility. If your team is familiar with or would be confortable learning Bot Framework SDK, Pattern 4.2 is likely a better fit.

## Solution Architecture

## Preparation

1. Install Azure CLI
2. Install Bicep
3. Install Bot Framework Composer
4. Ensure your subscription is enabled for Azure OpenAI
5. Clone repository / copy files locally
6. Edit the appsettings.json file

## Deployment
