Starting your AI/ML journey in Azure may seem daunting for some organizations and engineers, often leading to roadblocks in their initial scenarios. To address this challenge, providing a user-friendly and intuitive template becomes crucial. Such a template should serve as a guiding example, illustrating the complete AI/ML lifecycle, showcasing the integration of MLOps practices, detailing the setup of training pipelines, and offering insights into the processes of model training, deployment, and access. This ensures a smoother and more comprehensible transition into the world of Azure AI and ML.

This project aims to provide an "Azure AI/ML Easy Button" for common scenarios. Something that shows how the pieces fit together in easy to deploy templates. Using the **patterns** available here, engineers will be able to quickly setup a Azure ML/AI/Edge environment which optionally includes streaming & batch ingestion, Model training and creation, Scaling patterns and edge deployments.
