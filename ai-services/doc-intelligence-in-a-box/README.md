This solution leverages Azure AI Document Intelligence and Bicep to automate document processing tasks. It deploys necessary Azure resources using Bicep scripts and trains custom machine learning models for document extraction. Azure Data Lake Storage is used for storing sample data, and the trained models are integrated into Azure Functions for processing documents. This setup allows for easy customization and scalability for various document processing use cases.
